Since February of 2014, I've been Producer and Account Lead on @nikesportswear Instagram. As part of managing the day to day operations with the brand, I've built relationships across the NSW matrix, helped grow the community from 70k to over 1.4 million followers in less than one year. Other responsibilities, among others, include Location Scouting, Pre Production Scheduling, Composition of Deck presentations and account forecasting. Photos taken by Vincent Picone.
