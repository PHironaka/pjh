As a leading news anchor and celebrity, pitching for Dodge—or anything else for that matter—is a cinch. He doesn’t need scripts or have to study up on auto features. And because he’s Ron Burgundy, interpreting the modern Dodge Durango through his 1970s brain, he’s got a decidedly different take on the cross-over sport utility vehicle.

I had the privelege of working on this campaign with a talented team from Wieden + Kennedy. As Jr. Interactive Producer, my responsibility was to deliver a series of Rich Media and 40K flash banners in support of the premier of Anchorman 2. Here's a sampling of the work as well as my favorite spot from the campaign.
