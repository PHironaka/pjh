Calvin has the football. Johnson has the rest. This Nike Football campaign brings Calvin Johnsonâ€™s personality to life by creating an alter ego (Diddy) that manages the entertainment side of football. 

This was the only Nike campaign I helped produced while at Wieden. Got to work with Jeff Williams which was awesome. Partnered with media agency Razorfish to produce 40K/RM Banners, including an ESPN Homepage Takeover. Put it on me.
