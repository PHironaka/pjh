When a guy has Old Spice hair, great things happen. No, seriously. The hair actually does it. It literally does the thing. Weâ€™re serious, guys. Introducing the new Old Spice Hair Care and Styling Product Lineup.

Another in a series of hilariously outlandish Old Spice Campaigns. W+K partnered with Dev Shop Framestore to produce an interactive website, featuring a hair piece playing the sweet tunes of Huey Lewis and The News. Sadly, I was not part of this piece of the campaign, but I did produce flash banners to support the launch! I also helped launch the Old Spice Tumblr during this campaign, which can be viewed [ HERE](http://oldspice.tumblr.com).
