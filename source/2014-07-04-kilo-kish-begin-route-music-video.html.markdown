The video for “Begin Route” aligns neatly with the rest of Across’s dreamy nostalgia. Shot half in low contrast black and white and half in bleached out color, the video emphasizes the lines between past and present, roaming and home, love and loneliness. Kish, meanwhile, sleepily drawls over a languid beat. Kitsuné, who has included Kish on two past compilations and named her their FW 14 ambassador, will put the EP out on vinyl August 25th, and follow up with a travel-themed capsule collaboration with the singer in September.

Had the great opportunity to work on this  music video. As Producer, I was responsible for finding filming locations to correlate with the concept of the video. Other responsibilities include Call Sheet composition, Run Of Show, and herding of featured Prop (thanks Nick!).
