    <p>I had the opportunity to work on a redesign in March 2015 as we migrated from a CMS server-side platform to the Cloud Based, Static Site Generator Siteleaf. Responsibilities included Web Development, Design, Project Management, and custom Tumblr Theme. *note: this is NOT the current Madbury site.</p>

    <p>Another in a series of hilariously outlandish Old Spice Campaigns. W+K partnered with Dev Shop Framestore to produce an interactive website, featuring a hair piece playing the sweet tunes of Huey Lewis and The News. Sadly, I was not part of this piece of the campaign, but I did produce flash banners to support the launch! I also helped launch the Old Spice Tumblr during this campaign, which can be viewed HERE.</p>

    <p>I had the privelege of working on this campaign with a talented team from Wieden + Kennedy. As Jr. Interactive Producer, my responsibility was to deliver a series of Rich Media and 40K flash banners in support of the premier of Anchorman 2. Here's a sampling of the work as well as my favorite spot from the campaign.</p>
