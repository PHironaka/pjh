   <p>Already July. Wow. Time sure flies when you're having fun, or maybe it just flies when life happens all at once. Seems as good a time as ever to take a step back and take a look at what's transpired so far in 2015 and what's to come for the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>At the start of the year, Kam (my amazing girlfriend) and I decided to put together a list of goals we wanted to reach. Our lists varied from getting involved in a local charity, to entrepreneurial efforts, athletic achievements and more. All in all it was a fairly standard but ambitious set of goals, but hey who doesn't want to accomplish everything in a year? Lists are great. They force you to think big picture. They help you focus on the important things in life. I encourage everyone to create lists, so long as they follow two rules:</p>

<p>1.) Follow-through. Don't just write it down because it looks good. Make sure it's something you feel a serious connection to, and go do it!</p>

<p>2.) Progress over results. Depending on the ambition, there's a high likelihood you're going to reach all of your goals in a single year. It takes time, so remember to be patient.</p>

<p>I took a look at my list this week and I'm not gonna lie, there's still plenty of work to be done. One goal I have been able to reach, however, is traveling abroad with Kam. We were lucky enough to visit Paris, Barcelona and Mallorca. It was truly an amazing and unforgettable trip. Honestly don't think I've ever eaten so much food in my life before. I wish we had a few more extra days to travel around, especially in Paris. We're already planning our return trip back! Here's a few iphone pics from our travels:</p>

<p>I love to travel. I feel like every time I leave my little bubble in Venice, I'm able to see things through a different lens, a different perspective. And most importantly, it allows me time to think about the important things.</p>

<p>As I glance over at my list of Goals today, I can see that most of it has not been accomplished. Some of it hasn't been touched. But the important thing is that there is PROGRESS being made. I haven't been able to read one book per month, but I've read a few books and it's started to become a weekly habit again. I haven't yet volunteered at a local organization, but I've made contact and the wheels are in motion for that to start happening this summer.</p>

<p>I'm sure all my goals will not come to fruition in 5 months time, but I am excited to see what I'm able to get done from now until December. Day by day, week by week, I plan to hold myself accountable and make the effort. No excuses.</p>
